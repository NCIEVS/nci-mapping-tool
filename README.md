Welcome to the NCI EVS Mapping Tool Project!
==============================

The NCI EVS Mapping Tool supports mapping between term lists, value sets, terminology subsets, or whole 
terminologies using a mix of automated and manual methods.  This initial prototype release is used 
internally by EVS, but will need further development to reach a broader user community. 

The key capabilities of NCI EVS Mapping Tool include the following:
* Support concept mapping based on NCI Metathesaurus (i.e., the CUI and source atom relationships).
*	Support concept mapping between terminologies hosted by NCI CBIIT through the LexBIG terminology server.
*	Support mapping between two value sets.
*	Perform concept matching using algorithms supported by LexEVS API.
*	Provide hyper-link to the concept details page in NCI Term browser.
*	Support manual mapping.
*	Provide administrative functions (e.g., assign and maintain status of mapping entries).
*	Export to LexGrid XML and Microsoft excel formats.


NCI EVS Mapping Tool is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
