Welcome to the nci-mapping-tool Project!
==============================

NCI Mapping Tool was developed for supporting NCI internal operations. It provides a means for users to 
perform cross terminology mapping. Users would be able to place constraints on source or target objects. 

The key capabilities of NCI Mapping Tool include the following:
* Support concept mapping based on NCI Metathesaurus (i.e., the CUI and source atom relationships).
*	Support concept mapping between terminologies hosted by NCI CBIIT through the LexBIG terminology server.
*	Support mapping between two value sets.
*	Perform concept matching using algorithms supported by LexEVS API.
*	Provide hyper-link to the concept details page in NCI Term browser.
*	Support manual mapping.
*	Provide administrative functions (e.g., assign and maintain status of mapping entries).
*	Export to LexGrid XML and Microsoft excel formats.


nci-mapping-tool is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
